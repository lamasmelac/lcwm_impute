# lcwm_impute
This is an R program that allows imputations to be made on databases with a non-response unit using additional information from fully observed auxiliary variables. The implemented model approach is completely Bayesian and is based on mixed models of multivariate normal distributions. Specifically we use Gaussian Weighted Cluster Modeling. Gaussian Cluster-Weighted Modeling.
