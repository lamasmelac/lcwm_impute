# lcwm_impute
This is an R code that allows imputations to be made on databases with a non-response unit using additional information from fully observed auxiliary variables. The implemented model approach is completely Bayesian and is based on Multivariate Mixtures of Normal Distributions. Specifically we use Gaussian Cluster-Weighted Modeling.
