# lcwm_impute
This is an R program that allows imputations to be made on databases with a non-response unit using additional information from fully observed auxiliary variables. The model approach is completely Bayesian and makes use of a mixture model of multivariate normal distributions. Specifically we use the Gaussian Cluster-Weighted Modeling.
